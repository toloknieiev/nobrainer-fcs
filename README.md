# nobrainer-fcs
A python script made for simple users or lazy data wranglers to examine flow cytometry metadata on-the-fly.

This is a script made for my personal use for the purposes of inspecting .fcs file metadata. I decided to share it.

nobrainer-fcs functions as a crutch for [readfcs](https://github.com/laminlabs/readfcs) and provides a basic interactive user experience.

**Installation:**

1. Install readfcs using terminal:
`pip install readfcs`
2. Put the script into the folder with your .fcs files.
3. Open your folder in terminal:
`cd /PathToDir/`
4. Run script:
`python nobrainer-fcs.py`

 Follow the prompts and instructions.
